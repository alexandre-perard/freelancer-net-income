# Freelancer Net Income

This very simple application was written as a little programming exercise with
Angular. It doesn't pretend to be a fully fledged tax simulator!

It produces accurate results, though! Just be aware of some limitations: 

- It's based on income tax year 2025 rates (assessment year 2026).
- The social fund fee calculation is based on Partena Professional rate. Other
  social funds may apply different rates.
- The municipal tax calculation is based on the City of Brussels rate. Your
  municipality may apply a different rate.
- Dependants are not taken into account.
